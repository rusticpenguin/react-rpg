# react-rpg
An RPG system created in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). This project was inspired from games such as [EarthBound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthBound) and [Undertale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undertale).
___
## Using React to create an experience:
My goal with this project is to create a seamless RPG experience where the user can walk through an overworld and battle enemies for experience, items, and currency.

I would also like this project to be plug and play, allowing game developers and content creators to efficiently design their own game build in React.

## Planned Features:
 - Turn-based combat in the same vein as EarthBound, Undertale, and Pokemon
 - Recieve Experience, level-up, obtain ingame rewards 
 - Store player data on a server
 - Maneuver a character throughout an overworld
 - Dialogue Manager with NPC's
 - Sprite-based animations
 - Character Classes

## Techs:
 - [react](https://github.com/facebook/react)
 - [react-canvas](https://github.com/Flipboard/react-canvas) or [react-konva](https://github.com/konvajs/react-konva)... still have to do my research
 - [mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
 - [mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)
 - [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
 - [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
